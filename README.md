Watershed_Reduction
===================

An attempt to do map reduction on watershed data
using only the standard libraries, we attempt
to take publically available watershed data (needs citation) and reduce the level 6 polygons to the outter edge only level 2 polygon.

In essence, we want the "outline" of the level 2 mesh, based on the level 6 polygon information.
